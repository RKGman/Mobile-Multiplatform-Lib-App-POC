# Kotlin Multiplatform App and Shared Library POC

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ease of sharing a common library between Android and iOS.
Common shared code might require use of communicating with a server to handle business logic via HTTPS.

# TODO:

- Use IoC for dependency injection
- Determine if there is an HTTP client that will work in both native apps
