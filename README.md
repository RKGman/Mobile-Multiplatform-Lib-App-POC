# Kotlin Multiplatform App and Shared Library POC

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ease of sharing a common library between Android and iOS.
Common shared code might require use of communicating with a server to handle business logic via HTTPS.

# TODO:

- Create a basic Android app that will use the shared library
- Use IoC for dependency injection (in the library)
- Determine if there is an HTTP client that will work in both native apps
- Figure out a (budget friendly) way to develop for iOS / test library integration
    - Test in a macOS environment
